# Docker network and storage: Server <!-- omit in toc -->

**Objective**: build a simple REST API with some logging abilities as well as fetching information from other services

- [Run the example](#run-the-example)
- [Still simple API with Koa](#still-simple-api-with-koa)
  - [Log in logging file](#log-in-logging-file)
  - [Call another API](#call-another-api)

## Run the example

To run this server locally:

```sh
npm install
node index.js
```

## Still simple API with Koa

Nothing fancy here compared to the [Docker-Getting-Started server](../../docker-getting-started/server/README.md). I am still using Koa with Koa router as there are two endpoints:

- `GET: /` delivers the beer list but each request is logged
- `GET: /logs` returns the logs

### Log in logging file

When calling the root endpoint, this server is supposed to return a list of beers. See the [_API call_](#call-another-api) section for the content. This server also logs each incoming request, including 404 links and append the log in a logging file.

`/logs` endpoint then returns all the logs logged so far.

### Call another API

To return a list of beers, I want to get the list provided by the [Docker-Getting-Started server](../../docker-getting-started/server/README.md). An HTTP call being necessary, I tried to use the standard `http` tool but callback management ended up being complicated, I switched to Axios.
